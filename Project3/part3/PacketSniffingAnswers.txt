1. I used a script to find the ips that the phone send a packet to its port 80
'74.125.239.110.80', 
'54.160.80.253.80', 
'74.125.239.102.80', 
'171.67.215.200.80', 
'94.31.29.154.80'

2. I counted the number of distinct ports that 1 ip scans another ip. Note 10.30.5.234 also scanned 10.30.1.65's ports but the packets are reset packets which do not require
answer so it's not port scanning.
a) 10.30.1.65
b) 10.30.5.234
c) 999 ports in the range [1,65389] inclusive

3. I counted the most number of SYN packets from 1 ip to another ip
a) 10.30.12.152
b) 10.30.17.255
c) 26076

4. The injected packet is (as it is a resent packet after the seqno has been acknowledged, even with same TS value, but with different cksum)
IP (tos 0x0, ttl 64, id 44874, offset 0, flags [DF], proto TCP (6), length 451)
    10.30.22.101.64154 > 171.67.215.200.80: Flags [P.], cksum 0xe1c2 (correct), seq 1663:2062, ack 186953, win 65535, options [nop,nop,TS val 408566938 ecr 1998633308], length 399
	
and its cksum is 0xe1c2
